    title: My second post
    body: This is more for my own archiving purposes but maybe someone else might enjoy it too.
        First I added a console games section, with gameplay videos and walkthroughs of games I handpick. The PS2 section here also has several sub sections with various documents
        [console games](https://nest.machinecode.org/console_games/)

        Second thing I added was a 360 video folder. Also handpicked the ones I like the most, sorted by date modified too easily see latest. This is awesome though, I love 360 video!
